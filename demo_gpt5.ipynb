      "A microstrip (patch) antenna is a low-profile planar antenna built on a thin dielectric substrate that has a conducting ground plane on one side and a conducting “patch” on the other. The patch behaves like a resonator whose dimensions are set by the effective wavelength in the substrate, typically about half a wavelength: $L \\approx 0.5\\,\\lambda_{\\text{substrate}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\text{substrate}} = \\lambda_0/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r}$. Common patch shapes include rectangular, circular, and triangular, and the patch can be fed by a coaxial probe, a microstrip line, or via aperture coupling through a slot in the ground plane.\n",

      "- Structure: ground plane | dielectric substrate | metal patch (radiator).\n",
      "- Operation: the patch is a resonant cavity; dimensions scale with the effective wavelength in the substrate.\n",

      "- Cons: relatively narrow bandwidth and lower efficiency (often only a few percent bandwidth without enhancement).\n",
      "- Design trade-offs: higher εr shrinks size but narrows bandwidth; bandwidth can be improved with thicker, low-εr substrates, matching networks, parasitic patches; size can be reduced with short-circuited λ/4 designs.\n",

      "- A horn is a flared metallic waveguide that forms a large radiating aperture. It converts a guided wave inside the horn into a free-space wave; the fields across its aperture act as the radiation source (aperture fields). Common forms include pyramidal and conical horns. Typical feeds are waveguide or a coax-to-horn probe at the throat. Horns are aperture antennas and provide moderate to high gain with broad bandwidth, commonly used at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies and often as feeds for reflectors. Sources: Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics (6th ed.), pp. 403, 427–428 (fig. 9-2(g); section 9-7 on aperture radiation); Pozar, Microwave Engineering (4th ed.), p. 660 (aperture antennas have moderate to high gains).\n",
